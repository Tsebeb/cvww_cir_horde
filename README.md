# Horde Strategy for Class Incremental Learning with Repetition 

Our paper "Incremental Learning with Repetition via Pseudo-Feature Projection" has been accepted at the 
25th Computer Vision Winter Workshop (CVWW) at Graz. 

This repository contains the official reference implementation.
The code structure is based on [FACIL](https://github.com/mmasana/FACIL).

Code will be coming soon :)
